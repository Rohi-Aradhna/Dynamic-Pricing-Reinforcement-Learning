# Dynamic-Pricing-Reinforcement-Learning
Dynamic pricing simulation using reinforcement learning. Models demand with a logistic curve and compares ε-Greedy, Thompson Sampling, Greedy, and tuned UCB1. Achieves 55–68% optimal-price selection with fast convergence, showing how bandit algorithms adapt to customer behavior.
